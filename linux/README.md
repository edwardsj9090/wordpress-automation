# Wordpress Installer Script

This script will setup all of the prerequsite LAMP stack components and create a default WordPress database and DB user (you may want to change those post-install).

At the linux command line, do this:

1. `git clone https://github.com/edwardsj9090/wordpress-automation`
2. `cd wordpress-automation/linux`
3. `sh install_wp.sh`
